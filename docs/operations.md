# Operations

Status: Current

## Required calendar setup

1. Under the mailbox in `MICROSOFT_CALENDAR_USER`, create a secondary calendar
   named exactly `Fomo Maintenance`.
2. Keep `MICROSOFT_MAINTENANCE_CALENDAR_NAME=Fomo Maintenance`, or set
   `MICROSOFT_MAINTENANCE_CALENDAR_ID` to the calendar's Graph ID.
3. Grant the Azure app registration the Microsoft Graph application permission
   `Calendars.ReadWrite` and obtain administrator consent.
4. If an Exchange application access policy is used, allow the configured
   mailbox.

The ID setting takes precedence over the name. Name lookup is convenient for
initial setup; the ID setting is preferable if operators may rename calendars.

## Verification

```bash
npm ci
npm run verify
npm run build
```

Before production use, perform a paid Stripe test-mode booking and confirm:

1. A primary-calendar conflict is unavailable on the booking page.
2. A `Fomo Maintenance` calendar conflict is also unavailable.
3. A paid visit appears only in `Fomo Maintenance`.
4. The Stripe Checkout Session metadata has `calendarStatus=created`.
5. Replaying the webhook does not create a duplicate event.

## Troubleshooting

- `Microsoft calendar "Fomo Maintenance" was not found`: confirm the calendar
  belongs to the configured mailbox and that the name matches exactly, or set
  `MICROSOFT_MAINTENANCE_CALENDAR_ID`.
- `More than one Microsoft calendar is named ...`: set the calendar ID to make
  the target unambiguous.
- Availability returns HTTP 503: inspect server logs for primary or maintenance
  `calendarView` failures and verify the Azure app permission and access policy.
- Stripe metadata says `calendarStatus=failed`: payment succeeded but the
  Outlook event was not created; reconcile the booking manually and investigate
  the Graph error before retrying.

## Rollback

Revert the secondary-calendar change and restore the previous default-calendar
Graph paths, then redeploy. Existing events remain in whichever calendar they
were created and are not moved automatically.
